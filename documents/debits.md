## Debits

A debit is a transaction that takes points out of a loyalty program memberâ€™s account. Creating a debit object triggers the removal of points. A record of the debit is kept that can later be retrieved. A debit requires a member validation that has not been previously used for another transaction. Debits are stored for each loyalty program under /lps/<lp-id>/debits/.
