# Loyalty Partner API Reference Manual
For Points Loyalty Commerce Platform - Version 1.0

## Document Overview

This document describes the RESTful API services a Loyalty Partner can implement to enable members using Loyalty Commerce Applications built on the Points Loyalty Commerce Platform (LCP) to transact.

## Introducing the Loyalty Partner API

As a Loyalty Partner (LP), you can integrate with the LCP and all its Applications with these simple calls.

1. Member Validation (MV)
1. Credit/Debit Posting
1. Transfer Points to/from a member's account
1. Transaction Retry (posting or transfer)
1. Transaction Reversal
1. Single Sign On (SSO)

![LP API](../images/lp-overview.png)

A reference implementation for the LP API's member validation and credit/debit postings can be found in the [Loyalty Commerce Platform Github repository](https://github.com/Points/Loyalty-Commerce-Platform/tree/master/samples). Our example LCP web service will be "http://api.loyaltyprogram.com" below.

## Why use the Loyalty Partner API?

By integrating with the LCP via the LP API, you have the following advantages:
1. **Speed up** time to market
1. **Simple** RESTful API that can be re-used with your partners
1. **Instantaneously apply changes** to your webservices across permissioned loyalty Applications


## How do Applications and LPs interact?

When an Application executes a member validation, credit, or debit operation to you (the Loyalty Partner) via the LCP, the LCP will find the pre-configured URL for your loyalty program's API and that specific operation, and send an HTTP request to that URL.

For example, in a typical Buy Points transaction, an MV will precede a credit posting in the sequence illustrated.

![LP API - Buy example](../images/lp-api-buy.png)

## Member Validation

The basic API call for all LCP partners is the member validation (MV). Applications on the LCP will submit an MV request to confirm the validity of a member account and capture profile data to cater members' experience to their distinct needs and interests (e.g. with targeted offers).

The MV is the only configurable call. As a Loyalty Partner, you define what data fields you receive and share with Applications. The more data, the more personalized Applications can be for your members. See what Points recommends in the [Member Data section](#member-data) below.

The LCP will make an MV **request** that will contain a member account's identifying details (e.g. account ID, name). In return, your webservice will provide an MV **response** that:
1. Confirms the validity of a member and
1. Includes the member's profile data

Data fields in both the MV request and response are specified in their respective schemas. During the onboarding process, Points configures these schemas on your behalf.

You will receive the following parameters in MV requests:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Required</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>firstName</td>
      <td>First name of the loyalty program member</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>lastName</td>
      <td>Last name of the loyalty program member</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>memberId</td>
      <td>Member ID of the loyalty program member</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Sample MV request from Applications via the LCP:

    POST http://api.loyaltyprogram.com/MemberValidation
    {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "memberId": "A1234567890"
    }

A successful MV response should include member details similar to those below if the member account is valid:

    200 OK
    {
     "status": "success",
     "accountCreationDate": "2015-12-31",
     "accountStatus": "Active",
     "allowedRecipients": [
        {
            "email": "lizzie.doe@gmail.com",
            "firstName": "Elizabeth",
            "lastName": "Doe",
            "memberId": "C1234567890"
         },
         {
            "email": "james.doe@gmail.com",
            "firstName": "James",
            "lastName": "Doe",
            "memberId": "D1234567890"
         }
      ]
     "countryCode": "CA",
     "cobrand": "XYZ Co"
     "balance": 200000,
     "memberId": "A1234567890",
     "membershipLevel": "Gold",
     "eligibility": "TransferToAny",
     "email": "test@example.com",
     "expiredBalance": 15000
    }

An MV response for an invalid member must return a **status** and **statusMessage** with a helpful descriptor:

    200 OK
    {
       "status": "failure",
       "statusMessage": "Error: Unknown Member"
    }

## Credit or Debit Posting

As your loyalty members earn or redeem points, this service allows Applications on the LCP to post a debit and/or credit to a memberâ€™s account.

The following parameters are included in posting requests:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Required</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>callback</td>
      <td>The callback is a URI passed as a string that uniquely identifies a transaction in the LCP. This is helpful for Points' and your support teams if troubleshooting is required and it is strongly recommended that you store this string.</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>order</td>
      <td>Details of the order that this debit/credit is executed as part of</td>
      <td>N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>bonus</td>
      <td>A boolean value indicating if this is a bonus posting</td>
      <td>N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>amount</td>
      <td>Number of points to be added or removed from the member's account. This number is negative for debits and positive for credits.</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>pic</td>
      <td>With a single integration, the Product Identification Code is used for discerning which Application and promotion are associated to this transaction. The PIC can be any string.</td>
      <td>N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>firstName</td>
      <td>First name of the loyalty program member</td>
      <td>N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>lastName</td>
      <td>Last name of the loyalty program member</td>
      <td>N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>memberId</td>
      <td>Member ID of the loyalty program member. This is identical to the member ID in the MV.</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Sample posting request from Applications via the LCP:

    POST http://api.loyaltyprogram.com/Posting
    {
       "callback": "https://lcp.points.com/v1/lps/<lp-id>/credits/<id>",
       "amount": 100,
       "bonus": true|false,
       "order" : {
          "orderType": "GIFT",
          "createdAt": "2014-11-25T15:24:00.000000Z",      
          "confirmationNumber": "1111-2222-3333-4444-5555"
       },
       "pic": "POINTSGIFT",
       "memberId": "A1234567890"
    }

A posting response returns the **transactionId** and the **status**. In case of a *failure*, the response must also include a **statusMessage**. The **transactionId** is a string with a maximum length of 100 characters used by the Points support team to troubleshoot and for [transaction retries](./?doc=lp-reference#retry-a-transaction).

    200 OK
    {  
       "status": "success|failure",
       "statusMessage": "Error: Limit exceeded",
       "transactionId": "12345678"
    }

## Transfer Between Accounts

As part of your loyalty program features, you may wish to provide a service to allow Applications on the LCP to perform one-shot points transfers between loyalty member accounts. This API call withdraws/debits points from one account and deposits/credits them to another in a single transaction.

The following parameters are included in transfer requests:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Required</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>callback</td>
      <td>The callback is a URI passed as a string that uniquely identifies a transaction in the LCP. This is helpful for Points' and your support teams if troubleshooting is required and it is strongly recommended that you store this string.</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>order</td>
      <td>Details of the order that this debit/credit is executed as part of.</td>
      <td>N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>amount</td>
      <td>Number of points to be removed from the member's account and added to the recipient's. This number is negative (for debits).</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>pic</td>
      <td>With a single integration, the Product Identification Code is used for discerning which Application and promotion are associated to this transaction. The PIC can be any string.</td>
      <td>N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>member/firstName</td>
      <td>First name of the loyalty program member transacting</td>
      <td>N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>member/lastName</td>
      <td>Last name of the loyalty program member transacting</td>
      <td>N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>member/memberId</td>
      <td>Member ID of the loyalty program member transacting. This is identical to the member ID in the MV.</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>recipient/firstName</td>
      <td>First name of the loyalty program member receiving the points</td>
      <td>N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>recipient/lastName</td>
      <td>Last name of the loyalty program member receiving the points</td>
      <td>N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>recipient/memberId</td>
      <td>Member ID of the loyalty program member receiving the points</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Sample point transfer request from Applications via the LCP:

    POST http://api.loyaltyprogram.com/Transfer
    {
       "callback": "https://lcp.points.com/v1/lps/<lp-id>/credits/<id>",
       "amount": 100,
       "order" : {
          "orderType": "TRANSFER",
          "createdAt": "2015-11-25T15:24:00.000000Z",
          "confirmationNumber": "1111-2222-3333-4444-5555"
       },
       "pic": "TRANSFER",
       "member": {
          "memberId": "A1234567890"
       },
       "recipient": {
          "memberId": "B1234567890"
       }
    }

A point transfer response returns the **transactionId** and the **status**. In case of a *failure*, the response must include a **statusMessage**.

    200 OK
    {  
       "status": "success|failure",
       "statusMessage": "Error: Insufficient balance",
       "transactionId": "12345678"
    }

## Transaction Retry

Occasionally, your system may undergo maintenance or experience downtime. During this time, you can return a status of "*systemError*" instead of "*failure*" to the LCP for any transactions (credit/debit posting, transfer) received. "*systemError*" informs the Application on the LCP that the request passed may be correct For these transactions, your API should accept a call with the **transactionId**. The Points support team can then retry the transaction at a later time by sending the same **transactionId** used on the original request.

The following parameter is included in retry requests:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Required</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>transactionId</td>
      <td>ID of the transaction being reattempted. This should be used to ensure that the initial transaction was indeed not successful.</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Sample retry request from the LCP:

    POST http://api.loyaltyprogram.com/RetryTransaction
    {
       "transactionId": "12345678"
    }

A transaction retry response returns the **transactionId** and the **status**. In case of a *failure*, the response must include a **statusMessage**.

    200 OK
    {  
       "status": "success|failure",
       "statusMessage": "Error: Transaction already succeeded",
       "transactionId": "12345678"
    }

## Transaction Reversal

Transactions (postings or transfers) may be cancelled for any number of reasons and members' balances should be updated in a timely manner. You may wish to provide a service to handle these reversals automatically.

A transaction can be fully or partially reversed by sending the same **transactionId** used on the original request. The amount of points to reverse will always be specified and the sign (+/-) will indicate the operation to the member's points account. Positive should add points into a member's account, while negative should remove points.

Each reversal will be made on a successful transaction. If the cumulative amount to be reversed is more than the points originally transacted, the reversal should be rejected.

The following parameters are included in reversal requests:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Required</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>transactionId</td>
      <td>ID of the transaction being reversed. This should be used to ensure that the initial transaction was indeed successful.</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>amount</td>
      <td>Number of points to reverse for the transaction. Positive for credits and negative for debits. This field will be populated for all reversals.</td>
      <td>Y</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Sample reversal request from the LCP to remove 2000 points from the member account corresponding to the transactionId:

    POST http://api.loyaltyprogram.com/Reversal
    {
       "transactionId": "12345678",
       "amount": -2000
    }

A reversal response returns the **transactionId** and the **status**. In case of a *failure*, the response must include a **statusMessage**.

    200 OK
    {  
       "status": "success",
       "transactionId": "12345678"
    }

    400 BAD REQUEST
    {  
       "status": "failure",
       "statusMessage": "Error: No such transactionId",
       "transactionId": "12345678"
    }

## Headers

* **Content-Type**: application/json
* **Authorization**: Basic {Base64-encoded username:password}

### Call Authorization

We recommend using a combination of Basic Auth (a Base64-encoded username/password pair) and whitelisting Points IP addresses to authorize calls from the LCP.

## Single Sign On (SSO)

Before members can transact, you need to send them to desired Application. With SSO, your loyalty members only need to sign in *once* on your loyalty program site and continue logged in to Applications on the LCP.

![SSO MV](../images/sso-mv.png)

When a member is signed in and visits a link on your loyalty programâ€™s website to an LCP Application, your LP provides the member's profile data to the LCP and allows the Application to securely retrieve an MV delegate containing the member's information. Member profile data is crucial to presenting a great, personalized experience that is engaging and meets the member's needs.

SSO is a five-step process:

1. **Your loyalty program [creates an MV delegate](https://points.github.io/Loyalty-Commerce-Platform/?doc=api-reference#create-a-mv-delegate) on the LCP.** Your loyalty program provides the member info needed to create an MV and "delegates" the MV to the Application so that the Application has permission to access the MV. The LCP creates the MV and returns the MV URL to your loyalty program.
1. **Your loyalty program redirects the user to the Application and provides the Application with the MV delegate URL.** No member information is passed in the redirect. It is securely stored in the LCP.
1. **The Application [gets the MV delegate](https://points.github.io/Loyalty-Commerce-Platform/?doc=api-reference#get-a-mv-delegate) from the LCP using the MV delegate URL** to securely obtain the location of the MV.
1. **The Application [gets the MV](https://points.github.io/Loyalty-Commerce-Platform/?doc=api-reference#get-a-mv) from the LCP using the MV URL** in the MV delegate to securely obtain information about the member and perform transactions. Authenticating factors like the memberâ€™s password are not shared with the Application.
1. If necessary, the Application gets the member details from the LCP by appending "/member-details" to the MV URL to securely obtain additional information about the member.

A [reference implementation of the SSO API](https://github.com/Points/Loyalty-Commerce-Platform/tree/master/samples/java/sso-reference-implementation) can be found in the LCP Github repository.

**Note**: While an SSO MV replaces the functionality of an MV webservice, it is necessary to have a [Member Validation webservice](#member-validation) for transactions where a second member account is involved to ensure that account is valid. Also, if a member visits an Application directly and wishes to transact, their account can be validated with the MV through a simple login form.

## Member Data

Points recommends sharing the following data in your MV responses and SSO MV delegates. While this list is not exhaustive and additional data enables LCP Applications to further customize and enhance your members' experience, the following data fields are catalogued for your convenience.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

## Testing

The LCP has two environments: staging and production. Typically, these connect to an LP's test and production service respectively. The LCP expects that the LP's web service is promoted from test to production.

To test the integration, we can:
1. Call your LP webservice with a simulated LCP request.
1. Perform end-to-end test transactions with an Application on the LCP.

## Monitoring

The LCP may perform health checks on LP endpoints to guarantee that your members have a quality experience.
