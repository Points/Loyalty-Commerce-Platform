## MV Delegates

An MV delegate is a member validation that a loyalty program created for another application. MV delegates are used for Single Sign-On (SSO) behaviour. When a loyalty program application wants to redirect an authenticated member to a 3rd-party application, the loyalty program application can create an MV delegate so that the other application doesnâ€™t need to re-authenticate the user.
