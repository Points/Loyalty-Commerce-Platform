Samples and SDKs
=======

The Loyalty Commerce Platform (LCP) is a general purpose platform that makes it possible
to build a wide variety of applications. To help you get started
the LCP development team has pulled together a few examples and reference implementations
of how to integrate with the platform.

If you are looking to build a service that implements the [LP API](http://git.io/lpapi), you might want to consider starting with deploying a simple implementation to Heroku by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/Points/Loyalty-Commerce-Platform-LP-API-Heroku).
